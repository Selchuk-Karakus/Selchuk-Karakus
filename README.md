I'm a coding enthusiast and a former restaurant manager. Before my devotion to programming, I did years of professional work in the hospitality sector where I have picked up essential skills including teamwork, communication, leadership and vast knowledge of excellent customer service. Coming from a hospitality background and having the chance to work with people from all different walks of life has equipt me having strong peoples skill, a formidable work ethic and perseverance.

After Working in Hospitality for so long, knowing the job inside out had posed a mega comfort zone for me. The idea of leaving this comfortable place for something completely different like a career in coding seemed daunting, and I found myself searching for a new challenge:  and I just went for it. With the headfirst learning approach, I tried some free online coding courses to build a foundation for several months - and the rest is history! I came across CodeYourFuture, was impressed with the community and decided to join the eight-month Software Developer program to build on the skillset I had developed. During this journey, I was surrounded by self-motivated, highly driven individuals daily supported by volunteers from the tech industry.

I have a portfolio of some of the things I've built learning to code [here](https://selchuk-karakus.vercel.app/).
